          <li><span class='titles'>Potential Members:</span> Potential members are Cornell students looking for a technical/design club. There are two groups of potential members:
              <ul>
                  <li>Incoming Freshmen: These are people who are unaware about all the clubs at Cornell, and we want to capture their attention to join this club.</li>
                  <li>Enrolled Students: These are students who are looking for something exciting to do and are tired of the cumbersome procedure associated with joining a project team on campus.</li>

        <h3 class="work">Overview</h3>
        <p> Our client, Christine Mbaye Muchemu, is the co-founder of a natural haircare startup, Rashanak, alongside her sister. Together they've developed a natural hair care product for black women with 4c hair called Liyanga. The purpose of this website is to introduce the client's product to their target audience, black women with 4c hair. </p>
        <p> <span class='titles'>Target Audience</span></p>
        <p>The target audience for this website is black women with natural 4c hair (defined as hair that is very tightly coiled). These women are of all ages who are interested in:</p>
        <ol class="work_info">
          <li>Cutting the time spent on their natural hair care regimen.</li>
          <li>A product with all-natural ingredients for use on their hair and naturally altering their hair texture to be more manageable while retaining their curl pattern.</li>
          <li>Black women who have experience or none in caring for their natural hair.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class='titles'>Design Ideas and Choices</span></p>
        <ol class="work_info">
          <li>Background information on the company that makes the product.</li>
          <li>An ingredients list along with pictures of the ingredients will be useful for the clients.</li>
          <li>Directions on how to incorporate the product in their existing hair care regimen to decrease the number of steps of their original routine.</li>
          <li>Testimonials from other women who've used the product to see if the product is worth buying.</li>
          <li>Educational tips on how to naturally care for their hair texture.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="work">Features</h3>
        <p>Based on the needs of the client and audience, the website includes information on the client's background, why she ventured in creating the product, a description of the product and its ingredients, and hair care tips for black women with tightly coiled hair. The website also follows a modern design to convey that Liyanga is a product that understands the needs and time constraints of the modern woman, who doesn't have all day to spend washing her hair. The slideshow on the home page emphasizes that the product is all natural and therefore suitable for natural, chemically unaltered hair. Moreover, the website includes a contact form that allows women to easily leave feedback or reach out if they have any questions. We also created a Testimonials page, where potential customers can read how other women who have 4c hair felt about the product.</p>

        <h3 class="work">Overview</h3>
        <p> For my final graphic design project we had to do research on an artist and use his or her style to influence our work. I decided to choose Japanese artist and writer <strong>Yayoi Kusama</strong>. From her artwork <em>"Vegetables"</em> and one of her works from the exhibit <em>"A Dream I Dreamed,"</em> I created my own artwork called <em>"Baby Blue Citrus,"</em> which is shown above. I continued with the concept of organic objects from the first piece and made my main focus fruits, which in this case were the oranges. In respect to the background, I kept the mosaic-netted pattern in a slightly lighter blue. I did not want the background to feel empty, so I used the idea of the vibrant polka dots from the second inspiration to fill up the background. My work is presented on the two-page spread I designed and wrote. </p>

        <h3 class="work">Overview</h3>
        <p> For my first two-page spread project, I used a travel article from the Huffington Post. I decided to use two different shades of blue to keep the professional and clean theme of the newspaper. I used the lighter shade of blue to distinguish quotes from the rest of the text. The figure of the globe was used to add more color to the article and also kept with the theme of traveling. The title of the article and the figure are the center of the page, since it helps continue the theme of the article from the first page to the next.  </p>
